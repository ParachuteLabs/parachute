# Test Streaming Now

The app is running with THE ACTUAL FIX.

## What Was Wrong

The `isWaitingForResponse` flag was being set to `true`, then immediately cleared to `false` because the code thought the USER message (just added to DB) was a "new message" that should clear the waiting state.

## The Fix

Now it only clears waiting state when a new ASSISTANT message arrives, not when the user message appears.

## What You Should See Now

1. **Send a message** (e.g., "What's the latest AI news?")

2. **Immediately see**:
   - "..." with a spinner (this should FINALLY appear!)

3. **Within 2 seconds**:
   - First text chunk appears
   - Tool call indicators show up with:
     * Cloud icon for web searches
     * Query text
     * Spinner animation

4. **As tools run**:
   - Tool call status updates from spinner â†’ checkmark
   - Response text continues streaming

5. **When complete**:
   - Final message persists
   - "...", tool calls, and streaming chunks all clear

## Check Backend Logs For

```
ðŸ”Œ Subscribing to conversation: [id]
ðŸ’¬ Broadcasting chunk to 1 WebSocket connection(s)
ðŸ”§ Broadcasting tool call to 1 WebSocket connection(s)
âœ… Sent chunk to 1/1 connections
```

## Check Flutter Logs For

```
flutter: ðŸ“© WebSocket message received: message_chunk
flutter:    ðŸ’¬ Message chunk: [text]
flutter: ðŸ“© WebSocket message received: tool_call
flutter:    ðŸ”§ Tool call: "[query]" (fetch) - pending
flutter: âž• Adding tool call: [details]
flutter:    Active tool calls count: 1
```

## If It Still Doesn't Work

Check:
1. Is the app actually running? `ps aux | grep "app.app" | grep -v grep`
2. Is backend running? `curl http://localhost:8080/health`
3. Look at `/tmp/flutter-clean.log` for errors
4. Check backend terminal for WebSocket connection

**This fix addresses the ROOT CAUSE that's been preventing everything from working.**
