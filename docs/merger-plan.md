## Next Phase: Space SQLite & Knowledge System

See [docs/features/space-sqlite-knowledge-system.md](features/space-sqlite-knowledge-system.md) for the next major feature development.

The merger phases successfully created the foundation. Now we're building the knowledge management layer that makes Parachute a true second brain.
