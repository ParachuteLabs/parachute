# Parachute - Brand Identity

**Date:** October 20, 2025
**Purpose:** Define the Parachute brand, philosophy, and identity

---

## Name

**Parachute**

## Tagline

> "The mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if it's not open" — Frank Zappa

## Philosophy

Like a parachute, your mind works best when it's open. Parachute is built on the principle of **openness** in all dimensions:

### The Four Opens

1. **Open Protocols**
   - Built on Agent Client Protocol (ACP) - open standard
   - Supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) - open extensibility
   - Not locked into proprietary systems

2. **Open Data**
   - Your files, your control
   - Standard markdown (CLAUDE.md)
   - Local-first, cloud-optional
   - Export anytime, own your data

3. **Open Platforms**
   - iOS, Android, Web, Desktop
   - Works everywhere you think
   - Not locked to one device or OS

4. **Open Integration**
   - MCP servers connect to anything
   - GitHub, databases, search engines, APIs
   - Extensible by anyone

## What Parachute Is

**Your open, interoperable second brain powered by Claude AI**

Parachute is a spatial interface for thinking with AI. It combines:
- The simplicity of Claude Desktop
- The power of Claude Code
- The flexibility of being truly cross-platform
- The freedom of open standards

### Core Metaphor: Cognitive Spaces

Each **Space** is a room in your digital memory palace:
- Has its own CLAUDE.md file (persistent AI memory)
- Contains relevant files and resources
- Independent conversation history
- Optional MCP server configurations
- Separate context management

Think of switching Spaces like entering different rooms in your mind - each with its own purpose, context, and tools.

## What Parachute Is NOT

❌ **Not an IDE** - We're not trying to replace your code editor
❌ **Not a writing app** - We're a thinking tool that can help with writing
❌ **Not just a chatbot** - We're a cognitive workspace
❌ **Not locked-in** - Open protocols, open data, open platforms

## Value Propositions

### For Knowledge Workers

"Build your second brain across all your devices. Organize research, manage projects, and think with AI - all with your data under your control."

### For Researchers

"Manage sources, take notes, and explore ideas with AI assistance. Each research topic gets its own Space with persistent context and relevant files."

### For Writers

"Work on multiple writing projects, each with its own Space. Claude remembers the context of each story, article, or book - across all your devices."

### For Teams (Future)

"Share Spaces, collaborate on knowledge, and build organizational memory with AI assistance."

## User Stories

### Story 1: The Researcher
> "I keep separate Spaces for each research topic. My 'Climate Change' Space has all my papers, notes, and data sources. Claude remembers our entire conversation history and can reference any file. When I switch to my 'AI Ethics' Space, it's a completely different context. I can access everything from my phone when I'm reading in the library."

### Story 2: The Writer
> "I have a Space for each book I'm writing. Each one has character notes, outlines, and draft chapters. Claude maintains continuity within each story. I love that I can write on my iPad on the train, then seamlessly continue on my desktop at home."

### Story 3: The Consultant
> "Each client gets their own Space with relevant contracts, notes, and project files. The CLAUDE.md file in each Space tells Claude about the client's context, preferences, and history. I never mix up contexts anymore."
