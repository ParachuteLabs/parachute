## Quick Links

### For Developers

- **Start Here**: Read `omi-integration-summary.md` for quick overview
- **Deep Dive**: Read `omi-integration.md` for complete details
- **Testing**: Use `suggested-testing.md` checklist
- **Firmware**: See `/firmware/README.md` for building firmware

### For Testing

1. Read `suggested-testing.md`
2. Follow Omi device pairing procedure
3. Test background recording scenarios
4. Verify button tap detection
5. Test OTA firmware updates (if available)

## Key Concepts

### Background Recording
- App maintains BLE connection even when backgrounded
- Button press on device triggers recording
- Audio streams from device → phone via BLE
- Recording saved automatically to storage
- Works even when app is completely closed (killed)

### Audio Formats
- **Phone recordings**: M4A (AAC codec)
- **Device recordings**: WAV (PCM)
- Both compatible with Whisper transcription
- No conversion needed

### Button Tap Patterns
- Single tap: Quick voice note
- Double tap: Extended recording
- Triple tap: Special recording type
- Tap count stored in metadata: `buttonTapCount: 1|2|3`

### Firmware Updates
- Over-the-air (OTA) via Nordic DFU
- MCUboot bootloader for safe updates
- Version checking and compatibility
- See firmware-migration-plan.md for process

## Contributing

When working on the recorder feature:

1. **Read existing docs** before making changes
2. **Update relevant docs** when implementing features
3. **Add test cases** to suggested-testing.md
4. **Document decisions** in work-log/ if significant

## History

This documentation was migrated from the standalone recorder repository during Phase 1 of the Parachute merger (October 2025). It preserves the development history and integration decisions made during Omi device support development.
