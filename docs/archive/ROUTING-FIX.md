# Routing Fix - AI Chat Navigation

**Date**: October 25, 2025
**Issue**: Named routes not working after bottom navigation merger
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

---

## Problem

When we merged the recorder and created bottom navigation in `main.dart`, we removed the route table but left code using `Navigator.pushNamed()` with named routes like:
- `/conversations`
- `/chat`

This caused crashes with error:
```
Could not find a generator for route RouteSettings("/conversations", null)
in the _WidgetsAppState.
```

---

## Root Cause

The original `main.dart` had a route table:
```dart
routes: {
  '/': (context) => const SpaceListScreen(),
  '/conversations': (context) => const ConversationListScreen(),
  '/chat': (context) => const ChatScreen(),
}
```

The new bottom navigation `main.dart` removed these routes because:
1. The home screen is now `MainNavigationScreen` (not `SpaceListScreen`)
2. Bottom nav uses `IndexedStack` to switch between features
3. Named routes no longer needed for top-level navigation

But the AI Chat feature code still tried to use named routes for internal navigation.

---

## Solution

Replaced all `Navigator.pushNamed()` calls with direct `Navigator.push()` + `MaterialPageRoute`:

### Files Fixed (3 total):

**1. space_list_screen.dart**
```dart
// BEFORE
Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/conversations');

// AFTER
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => const ConversationListScreen(),
  ),
);
```

**2. create_conversation_dialog.dart**
```dart
// BEFORE
Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/chat');

// AFTER
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => const ChatScreen(),
  ),
);
```

**3. conversation_list_screen.dart**
```dart
// BEFORE
Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/chat');

// AFTER
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => const ChatScreen(),
  ),
);
```

## Changes Made

### Import Additions

**app/lib/features/spaces/screens/space_list_screen.dart**
```dart
+import '../../conversations/screens/conversation_list_screen.dart';
```

**app/lib/features/conversations/widgets/create_conversation_dialog.dart**
```dart
+import '../../chat/screens/chat_screen.dart';
```

**app/lib/features/conversations/screens/conversation_list_screen.dart**
```dart
+import '../../chat/screens/chat_screen.dart';
```

## Verification

✅ **Code Scan**: No more `Navigator.pushNamed()` calls in `/lib` directory
✅ **Flutter Analyze**: No new errors introduced
✅ **Navigation Flow**: All AI Chat navigation now uses direct routes

## Navigation Flow (After Fix)

```
MainNavigationScreen (Bottom Nav)
├── Tab 0: AI Chat
│   └── SpaceListScreen
│       └── [tap space] → Navigator.push → ConversationListScreen
│           ├── [tap conversation] → Navigator.push → ChatScreen
│           └── [create conversation] → Navigator.push → ChatScreen
└── Tab 1: Recorder
    └── recorder.HomeScreen
        └── [recorder navigation unchanged]
```

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Option 1: Keep Named Routes (Not Chosen)
- Add route table back to `MaterialApp`
- More complex with bottom navigation
- Routes wouldn't play well with IndexedStack

### Option 2: Use go_router (Not Chosen)
- Already have `go_router` dependency
- Overkill for simple navigation needs
- Would require more refactoring

### Option 3: Direct Navigation (CHOSEN ✅)
- Simple and straightforward
- Works well with bottom navigation
- No external dependencies needed
- Easy to understand

## Testing Checklist

Now please test the AI Chat navigation flow:

### Space Navigation
- [ ] Launch app - see space list
- [ ] Tap on a space
- [ ] Should navigate to conversations list (no crash)
- [ ] Should show conversations for that space

### Conversation Navigation
- [ ] From conversations list, tap a conversation
- [ ] Should navigate to chat screen (no crash)
- [ ] Should show chat interface

### Create Conversation
- [ ] From conversations list, tap FAB to create conversation
- [ ] Enter title and create
- [ ] Should auto-navigate to chat screen (no crash)
- [ ] Should show new conversation ready for messages

### Back Navigation
- [ ] From chat screen, tap back
- [ ] Should return to conversations list
- [ ] From conversations list, tap back
- [ ] Should return to space list

## Future Considerations

If we need more complex routing in the future (deep linking, web URLs, etc.), we could:
1. Migrate to `go_router` package (already in dependencies)
2. Implement proper route guards and middleware
3. Add route parameters and query strings

For now, direct navigation is sufficient and simpler.

**Status**: ✅ Fixed and ready for testing
