## What Was Done

Successfully merged the standalone voice recorder app into Parachute as an integrated feature with bottom navigation.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Code Migration
✅ Copied all recorder code to `app/lib/features/recorder/`
- 32 Dart files migrated
- All imports updated from `package:parachute/` to `package:app/features/recorder/`
- Directory structure follows Parachute's feature pattern

### 2. Dependencies Merged
✅ Updated `app/pubspec.yaml` with recorder dependencies:
- Audio: `record`, `just_audio`
- Bluetooth: `flutter_blue_plus`
- AI: `whisper_ggml`, `opus_dart`, `opus_flutter`
- Utilities: `permission_handler`, `flutter_local_notifications`, `nordic_dfu`
- Upgraded Riverpod from 2.5.0 to 2.6.1
- All dependencies resolved successfully

### 3. Main App Navigation
✅ Created new `app/lib/main.dart` with bottom navigation:
- Two tabs: "AI Chat" and "Recorder"
- IndexedStack for state preservation between tabs
- Integrated Opus codec initialization from recorder
- Added global error handling from recorder

### 4. Platform Configurations
✅ Updated macOS entitlements and permissions:
- **DebugProfile.entitlements**: Added audio input and file access
- **Release.entitlements**: Added audio input and file access
- **Info.plist**: Added microphone and Bluetooth usage descriptions

### 5. Assets
✅ Copied firmware assets:
- `app/assets/firmware/` with Omi device firmware documentation
- Updated pubspec.yaml to include firmware assets

### 6. Documentation
✅ Created/updated documentation:
- `docs/merger-plan.md` - Complete Phase 1 implementation plan
- `app/lib/features/recorder/CLAUDE.md` - Recorder feature context
- `docs/MERGER-SUMMARY.md` - This summary
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with recorder info
- Updated `README.md` with voice recorder feature

### 7. Build Verification
✅ macOS build succeeded:
- `flutter build macos --debug` completed successfully
- Minor warnings in Whisper GGML native code (expected)
- No critical errors
- App ready for testing

## Testing Checklist

### Ready for User Testing:

**AI Chat Features** (regression testing):
- [ ] Can view space list
- [ ] Can create new space
- [ ] Can create conversation in space
- [ ] Can send messages in chat
- [ ] Can receive streaming responses from Claude
- [ ] WebSocket connection works
- [ ] Navigation works (conversations list, chat)

**Recorder Features** (new functionality):

- [ ] Can start new recording
- [ ] Can stop recording and save
- [ ] Can play back recordings
- [ ] Can delete recordings
- [ ] Can access settings

- [ ] State persists when switching tabs
- [ ] No crashes when switching tabs
- [ ] Permissions are requested correctly

## Known Issues

1. **Flutter Markdown Deprecated**: The flutter_markdown package is discontinued. Consider migration in future.

2. **Opus Windows Plugin Deprecation**: Warning about `dartPluginClass: none` - doesn't affect macOS/iOS.

3. **Whisper Warnings**: Native code warnings in Whisper GGML (integer precision) - these are from the third-party package and don't affect functionality.

4. **iOS/Android Not Tested**: Platform configs were only updated for macOS. iOS and Android will need similar permission additions if testing on those platforms.

---

## Next Steps (After User Validation)

### If Testing Passes:
1. User confirms all features work
2. Get approval to commit
3. Create detailed commit message
4. Tag as `v1.0.0-recorder-merged` or similar
5. Consider archiving the recorder repository

### Phase 2 (Future):
- Visual unification (harmonize themes)
- Merge settings screens
- Unified navigation patterns
- Polish animations and transitions

### Phase 3 (Future):
- Backend integration for cloud storage
- Recording upload and sync
- AI chat can reference recordings
- Cross-device recording access

---

## Success Metrics

✅ **All Phase 1 Goals Met**:
1. All recorder code lives in Parachute repository
2. App builds successfully
3. Bottom navigation implemented
4. Both features accessible and independent
5. Documentation complete
6. Ready for user testing

## Notes for Future Development

### Storage Service Abstraction
As planned, the StorageService is ready for Phase 3 backend integration:
- Current: Uses SharedPreferences + local file system
- Future: Can create abstract interface and swap implementation
- Keep business logic separate from storage

### Theme Considerations
Two theme systems currently coexist:
- Parachute: Material3 with light blue seed color
- Recorder: Custom theme with Google Fonts and forest green
- Phase 2 will harmonize these

### Platform Expansion
If expanding to iOS/Android:
- Add microphone permissions to iOS Info.plist
- Add Bluetooth permissions to iOS Info.plist
- Add RECORD_AUDIO, BLUETOOTH permissions to Android manifest
- Test on each platform thoroughly

**Phase 1 Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for User Validation
