## Overview

Phase 2 focused on unifying the visual design and user experience across the Parachute application, which combines AI Chat and Voice Recorder features.

---

## Objectives Completed

### 1. ✅ Unified Theme System

**Created:** `app/lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart`

- Moved recorder's well-designed theme to core for app-wide use
- Features forest green (#2E7D32) primary color with blue (#1976D2) secondary
- Uses Google Fonts Inter for professional typography
- Full Material 3 support with light and dark modes
- Consistent styling for:
  - App bars
  - Bottom navigation
  - Floating action buttons
  - Cards
  - Text styles

**Removed:**
- `app/lib/features/recorder/theme.dart` (moved to core)

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Main Application

**Updated:** `app/lib/main.dart`

- Integrated unified theme (AppTheme.lightTheme, AppTheme.darkTheme)
- Enhanced bottom navigation bar with:
  - Active/inactive icon states
  - Tooltips for accessibility
  - Better visual feedback
- Removed duplicate basic theme code

### 3. ✅ Unified Settings Screen

**Created:** `app/lib/features/settings/screens/settings_screen.dart`

- Moved settings from recorder-only to shared location
- Accessible from both AI Chat and Recorder sections
- Contains all app configuration:
  - Sync folder configuration
  - Omi device pairing & firmware updates
  - Transcription settings (API vs Local Whisper)
  - OpenAI API key management
  - Whisper model downloads

**Removed:**
- `app/lib/features/recorder/screens/settings_screen.dart` (moved to shared)

**Updated imports in:**
- `app/lib/features/recorder/screens/home_screen.dart`
- `app/lib/features/recorder/screens/post_recording_screen.dart`
- `app/lib/features/spaces/screens/space_list_screen.dart` (added settings button)

### 4. ✅ Consistent App Bar Titles

**Updated Screen Titles:**
- AI Chat: "AI Chat" (previously "Parachute" with icon)
- Recorder: "Voice Recorder" (previously "Parachute")
- Reasoning: The app name is "Parachute" - no need to repeat in every screen

### 5. ✅ Navigation Polish

**Bottom Navigation Enhancements:**
- AI Chat: `chat_bubble_outline` → `chat_bubble` (active)
- Recorder: `mic_none` → `mic` (active)
- Tooltips: "AI Chat with Claude" and "Voice Recorder"
- Smooth transitions with IndexedStack

**Settings Access:**
- Added settings button to AI Chat screen
- Settings button in Recorder screen (already existed)
- Both navigate to the same unified settings
