**Your open, interoperable second brain powered by Claude AI**

## What is Parachute?

Parachute is a cross-platform application that makes the Agent Client Protocol (ACP) as accessible as Claude Desktop, but with the power of local file access, MCP servers, and true multi-platform availability. It also includes integrated voice recording capabilities with AI transcription.

### Core Features

**AI Chat with Spaces**
Each **Space** is a cognitive context - a room in your digital memory palace:

- Has its own `CLAUDE.md` file (persistent AI memory)
- Contains relevant files and resources
- Independent conversation history
- Optional MCP server configurations
- Works across all your devices

**Voice Recorder**
Capture thoughts and conversations effortlessly:

- Local microphone recording
- Omi device integration (Bluetooth pendant)
- AI transcription (local Whisper models)
- Gemma 2B model for intelligent title generation
- Recording management and playback
- Transcript viewing and editing

**Vault-Based File System**
Your data, your way:

- Configurable vault location (default: `~/Parachute/`)
- Works with Obsidian, Logseq, and other markdown vaults
- Customizable subfolder names (`captures/`, `spaces/`)
- Platform-specific storage (macOS, Android, iOS)
- All data local and portable
- No lock-in, standard formats

### Built on Openness

1. **Open Protocols** - Built on ACP & MCP (not proprietary)
2. **Open Data** - Your files, your control, standard formats
3. **Open Platforms** - iOS, Android, Web, Desktop
4. **Open Integration** - Connect to anything via MCP servers
