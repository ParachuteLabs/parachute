# Recorder Feature - CLAUDE.md

**Context for Claude Code when working with the voice recorder feature.**

---

## Overview

The recorder feature provides voice recording capabilities with Omi hardware device support and local Whisper transcription.

**Location**: `app/lib/features/recorder/`

**Key Features**:
- Local audio recording (microphone)
- Omi device Bluetooth integration for pendant recording
- Local Whisper AI transcription
- Recording management (list, play, delete, share)
- Firmware OTA updates for Omi devices

## Key Services

### AudioService (`services/audio_service.dart`)
Handles local microphone recording and playback.
- Uses `record` package for recording
- Uses `just_audio` for playback
- Manages recording state and file paths

### StorageService (`services/storage_service.dart`)
Manages recording persistence using SharedPreferences.
- Saves/loads recording metadata
- File system operations
- **IMPORTANT**: This will be abstracted for Phase 3 backend integration

### WhisperService (`services/whisper_service.dart`)
Local AI transcription using Whisper GGML models.
- Downloads and manages Whisper models
- Transcribes recordings locally on-device
- No cloud API calls needed

### Omi Services (`services/omi/`)
Bluetooth integration with Omi hardware pendant:
- `omi_bluetooth_service.dart` - Device discovery and pairing
- `omi_connection.dart` - Connection management
- `device_connection.dart` - Audio streaming
- `omi_firmware_service.dart` - OTA firmware updates

---

## Important Models

### Recording (`models/recording.dart`)
```dart
class Recording {
  String id;
  String title;
  String? description;
  DateTime timestamp;
  int durationMillis;
  String filePath;
  String? transcription;
  RecordingSource source; // phone or omi
}
```

### OmiDevice (`models/omi_device.dart`)
Represents a paired Omi Bluetooth device with firmware info.

---

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Field to Recording
1. Update `models/recording.dart`
2. Update `toJson()` and `fromJson()` methods
3. Update `repositories/recording_repository.dart` if needed
4. Update UI in relevant screens

### Modifying Recording Storage
**Current**: Uses SharedPreferences + local file system
**Future (Phase 3)**: Will use backend API

When modifying storage:
- Keep changes in `StorageService`
- Use interface/abstract pattern (see Phase 3 plan)
- Don't couple UI directly to storage implementation

---

## UI Screens

- `home_screen.dart` - Recording list (main recorder screen)
- `recording_screen.dart` - Active recording interface
- `post_recording_screen.dart` - Edit/transcribe after recording
- `recording_detail_screen.dart` - View/play individual recording
- `device_pairing_screen.dart` - Omi device setup
- `settings_screen.dart` - Recorder settings (Whisper models, etc.)

---

## Dependencies

### Audio
- `record: ^6.1.2` - Microphone recording
- `just_audio: ^0.9.42` - Audio playback

### Bluetooth
- `flutter_blue_plus: ^1.33.6` - Omi device communication

### AI
- `whisper_ggml: ^1.7.0` - Local transcription
- `opus_dart` / `opus_flutter` - Audio codec for Omi

### Utilities
- `permission_handler` - Microphone/Bluetooth permissions
- `flutter_local_notifications` - Background recording notifications
- `nordic_dfu` - Omi firmware updates

---

## Common Issues

### Permission Errors
Ensure macOS entitlements include:
- `com.apple.security.device.audio-input`
- `com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-write`

### Omi Connection Issues
- Check Bluetooth permissions
- Verify FlutterBluePlus initialization in main.dart
- Opus codec must be initialized for audio decoding

### Whisper Transcription Failures
- Model must be downloaded first (check settings)
- Requires sufficient device storage
- Processing can be slow on large files

---

## Future Integration (Phase 3)

The recorder will integrate with Parachute backend:

**Planned Changes**:
- Upload recordings to cloud storage
- Backend transcription API (alternative to local Whisper)
- Cross-device sync
- AI chat can reference recordings
- Shared recording links

**Preparation**:
- StorageService uses interface pattern for easy swap
- Recording model has optional `cloudUrl` field (add in Phase 3)
- Keep business logic separate from storage implementation

---

## Testing

**Manual Testing**:
```bash
cd app
flutter run -d macos
# Navigate to "Recorder" tab
# Test recording, playback, transcription
```

**Omi Testing** (requires hardware):
- Pair Omi device via settings
- Start recording from device
- Verify audio streams to app
- Test firmware update if available
