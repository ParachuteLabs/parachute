# Parachute Development Roadmap

**Last Updated**: November 1, 2025

---

## Current Focus: Space SQLite Knowledge System

**Status**: üöß In Active Development
**Priority**: P0
**Timeline**: Nov 2025

Enable spaces to have structured knowledge management with SQLite databases that link to canonical notes in `{vault}/{captures}/` while allowing cross-pollination between spaces.

**See**: [docs/features/space-sqlite-knowledge-system.md](docs/features/space-sqlite-knowledge-system.md)

- [ ] Dynamic context injection
- [ ] Documentation for effective system prompts

**Target Completion**: Mid-November 2025

## Near-Term Roadmap (Q4 2025)

### üîú Multi-Device Sync

**Priority**: P1
**Status**: Planning

- Backend cloud service (optional, privacy-first)
- E2E encryption for synced data
- Conflict resolution for conversations and notes
- Mobile app support (iOS/Android)

**Why**: Enable using Parachute across devices while maintaining privacy

### üîú Smart Note Management

**Priority**: P1
**Status**: Backlog

- Auto-suggest spaces when saving recordings
- Tag suggestions based on content
- Automatic context generation using Claude
- "Similar notes" recommendations

**Why**: Reduce manual work, improve knowledge organization

---

## Medium-Term Roadmap (Q1 2026)

### Knowledge Graph Visualization

**Priority**: P2
**Status**: Concept

- Visual map of notes, spaces, and relationships
- "What connects these two spaces?"
- Timeline view of knowledge evolution
- Cluster detection (similar notes)

**Why**: Enable visual discovery and pattern recognition

### Custom Space Templates

**Priority**: P2
**Status**: Concept

Create templates for common space types:

- Project spaces (tasks, milestones, issues)
- Research spaces (papers, citations, hypotheses)
- Personal spaces (habits, reflections, goals)
- Creative spaces (ideas, drafts, inspirations)

**Why**: Jumpstart space setup, encourage best practices

### Advanced Search & Query

**Priority**: P2
**Status**: Concept

- Natural language queries ("farming notes from last month")
- Semantic search using embeddings
- Cross-space queries
- Export query results

**Why**: Find information faster, discover connections

---

## Long-Term Vision (2026+)

### Collaborative Spaces

**Priority**: P3
**Status**: Vision

- Share spaces with team members
- Permissions per space
- Sync while maintaining privacy for personal notes
- Comments and discussions

**Why**: Enable team knowledge management

### Mobile-First Recorder

**Priority**: P2
**Status**: Vision

- Native mobile app with better recording
- Background recording with Omi
- Offline-first sync
- Widget for quick capture

**Why**: Most voice notes are captured on mobile

### Plugin System

**Priority**: P3
**Status**: Vision

- Space plugins for custom functionality
- Custom visualizations
- Integration with external tools (Obsidian, Notion, etc.)
- API for third-party apps

**Why**: Extensibility without bloat

### AI-Powered Insights

**Priority**: P3
**Status**: Vision

- Weekly/monthly summaries of notes
- Pattern detection across spaces
- Proactive suggestions ("You haven't reviewed farming notes in 2 weeks")
- Automated tagging and categorization

**Why**: Surface insights user might miss

## Non-Goals

Things we've explicitly decided **not** to pursue:

- ‚ùå Ads or attention-harvesting mechanics
- ‚ùå Required cloud sync (always local-first)
- ‚ùå Lock-in formats (use markdown, standard SQLite)
- ‚ùå Cryptocurrency/blockchain integration
- ‚ùå AI training on user data without explicit consent

---

## Decision Log

## How to Contribute Ideas

Have an idea for Parachute? Here's how to propose it:

1. **Check existing docs** - Review this roadmap and feature docs
2. **Open an issue** - Describe the problem and proposed solution
3. **Discuss trade-offs** - What's gained? What's the cost?
4. **Prototype if possible** - Code speaks louder than words
5. **Iterate** - Feedback shapes the best features

---

## Roadmap Principles

1. **Local-First**: User owns their data, always
2. **Privacy by Default**: No tracking, no ads, no surveillance
3. **Open & Interoperable**: Use standard formats, enable export
4. **Thoughtful AI**: Enhance thinking, don't replace it
5. **Sustainable Pace**: Quality over speed, avoid burnout
6. **User-Driven**: Build what users need, not what's trendy
